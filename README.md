# ALSPAC SNP Extractor

This pipeline allows for the rapid extraction of specified SNPs of interest for future use in a range of analyses such as Mendelian Randomization, creation of Polygenic Risk Scores, etc. 

## Getting Started

The pipeline is written to work with the ALSPAC Genome-wide - HRC Imputed Dataset, which consists of individual chromosome .bgen files named 'filtered_01.bgen' to 'filtered_22.bgen'.

It requires the following files to operate:

ALSPAC_SNP_Extraction.sh - The code to run the programme.
params - A text file that allows the user to specify the necessary directories on their operating system.
SNP List - A list of the desired SNPS for extraction.
